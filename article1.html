Do you love solving complex problems? Are you interested in electronics, programming, and mechanics? You may want to consider a career as a robotics engineer!

A robotics engineer is a behind-the-scenes designer responsible for creating robots and robotic systems that are able to perform duties that humans are either unable, or prefer not to complete. For example, the Roomba was created to help humans with the mundane task of vacuuming floors.

Through their creations, robotics engineers help to make jobs safer, easier, and more efficient.
